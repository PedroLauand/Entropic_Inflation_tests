Status Report: Ray Set Update + Spiral/Feasibility Alignment
============================================================

Summary
-------
We updated the Shannon ray set and aligned the spiral LP constraints with the
feasibility_test constraints. After the fixes, both implementations now agree
on infeasible rays for the new 10‑ray list.

Key Corrections
---------------
1) Feasibility test (Feas_problem.py)
   - Fixed the unusual equality to enforce C1 ⟂ {B0,A1}:
     H(B0,A1,C1) = H(B0,A1) + H(C1)
   - This corrects the earlier (incorrect) term H(B0,A1,C1) = H(B0,A1) + H(A1).

2) Spiral LP (shannon_spiral_lp.py)
   - Added independence equalities to match feasibility_test:
     H(C0,A1,B1) = H(C0,A1) + H(B1)
     H(A0,B1,C1) = H(A0,B1) + H(C1)
     H(B0,A1,C1) = H(B0,A1) + H(C1)
     H(A0,C1)    = H(A0) + H(C1)
     H(B0,A1)    = H(B0) + H(A1)
     H(C0,B1)    = H(C0) + H(B1)
   - Kept minimal tripartite independence for (A1,B1,C1):
     I(A1;B1,C1)=0 and I(B1;C1)=0, which imply
     H(A1,B1,C1)=H(A1)+H(B1)+H(C1).

3) Ray Set Update
   - Replaced the legacy 17‑ray list with the new 10 rays obtained from:
     full Shannon constraints + the 7 “array” inequalities + h >= 0.
   - These rays are now used consistently in spiral LP and feasibility test
     comparisons.

Current 10‑Ray Feasibility Results (matching)
---------------------------------------------
Using the updated 10‑ray set:

- infeasible (spiral lp):      [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9]
- infeasible (feasibility_test): [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9]
- only in spiral lp:           []
- only in feasibility_test:    []

Conclusion
----------
After fixing the unusual equality and adding the missing independence constraints
in spiral LP, both implementations now impose the same conditions and produce
identical infeasibility lists for the new ray set.
